# Memory Game

A simple "Simon" memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

> **Prerequisites:** Youâ€™ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.

To get started, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory: `git clone https://github.com/ronit567/memory-game.git` then `cd memory-game`.

Install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

Start the game with `npm start`. After a few seconds, the game will open in your default browser. If the browser does not open automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the terminal).

If you encounter issues, ensure Node.js is installed correctly and all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` again.
